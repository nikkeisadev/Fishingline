## Upcoming new ideas! 🐠
*1.* Fish Species Database: A comprehensive database of different fish species, including their characteristics, habitats, and the best methods to catch them.

*2.* Weather Forecast: Since weather conditions can significantly impact fishing, integrating a weather forecast feature would be beneficial. It could provide information on temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and other relevant weather details.

*3.* Tide Information: For sea fishing, tide information is crucial. Your app could provide high tide and low tide timings.

*4.* Fishing Regulations: Information about local fishing regulations, such as fishing seasons, size limits, and catch limits, can help users fish responsibly and legally.

*5.* Location Services: Using GPS, the app could suggest nearby fishing spots or allow users to save their favorite locations.

*6.* Catch Log: Allow users to record details about their catches, such as species, weight, length, location, and even photos.

*7.* Social Features: Users could share their catches with others, view and like other people’s catches, and exchange tips and experiences.

*8.* Equipment Suggestions: Based on the targeted fish species and current weather conditions, the app could suggest the most suitable fishing gear and bait.

*9.* Tutorial and Tips: For beginners, having tutorials on different fishing techniques, knot-tying instructions, and other fishing tips would be helpful.

*10.* Augmented Reality (AR) Feature: An AR feature could be used to identify fish species from a photo or to show the types of fish that might be found in a body of water.
